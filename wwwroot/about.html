    <h1>About Smart Metro and LUNGSOD</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Smart Metro</strong> is a research project funded by the Department of Science and Technology - Philippine Council for Industry, Energy, and Emerging Technology Research and Development <a href="https://pcieerd.dost.gov.ph/">(DOST-PCIEERD)</a> implemented by the UP Training Center for Applied Geodesy and Photogrammetry (UP TCAGP). It is an offshoot of <strong>Project LUNGSOD</strong>, a link-up of geomatics and social science research for the development of smarter cities funded and implemented by the same institutions above. Smart Metro intends to explore different scales and aspects of smart development, specifically the comprehensive and collaborative development of LGUs within a region.
      </p>

      <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3">
        <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvYq-UetUE"></iframe>
      </div>

      </p>
        The <strong>Smart Metro Digital Twin</strong> is web-based application created for the member LGUs of the Metro-Iloilo Guimaras Economic Development Council <a href="https://metroiloiloguimaras.org/">(MIGEDC)</a> which are Cabatuan, Guimaras, Iloilo City, Leganes, Oton, Pavia, San Miguel, and Santa Barbara. This website allows map-based access to spatial data from the said LGUs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>Smart Metro Digital Twin</strong> uses data from the MIGEDC LGUs. When you access data through it, you are typically accessing the data directly from the LGUs which are the custodian of that data.
      </p>

      <p>The <strong>Smart Metro Digital Twin</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>provides easy access to authoritative and other spatial data from the LGUs</li>
         <li>facilitates the distribution and sharing of spatial data and dissemination of other crucial information</li>
         <li>provides an open framework of geospatial data services that supports commercial and community innovation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        To see what data is available on the platform, refer to the Data Catalogue in the <a href="https://new.digitaltwin.lungsod.ph">Smart Metro Digital Twin</a> itself. Click the <b>Data Catalogue</b> tab and expand the Data Set group names.
      </p>

      <h2>How to use the Digital Twin</h2>

      <p>
        Just go to <a href="https://new.digitaltwin.lungsod.ph">https://new.digitaltwin.lungsod.ph</a>. Most operations are obvious, but you can click the <a href="help/help.html">Help and FAQs</a> button near the top of this page for specific instructions.
      </p>

      <p>
        For further information, send an email to <a href="mailto:smartmetro.upd@up.edu.ph">smartmetro.upd@up.edu.ph</a> or <a href="mailto:projectlungsod.upd@up.edu.ph">projectlungsod.upd@up.edu.ph</a>. Feel free to send us feedback and bug reports.
      </p>

      <h2>Contributing Data to the Smart Metro Digital Twin</h2>

      <p>
        Those who wish to find out more information about contributing data sets to the Smart Metro Digital Twin should email send an email to <a href="mailto:smartmetro.upd@up.edu.ph">smartmetro.upd@up.edu.ph</a> or <a href="mailto:projectlungsod.upd@up.edu.ph">projectlungsod.upd@up.edu.ph</a> with their questions. Typically, the platform does not permanently store external data itself, but refers to the data provided by the data contributors (i.e., the MIGEDC LGUs), directly taking that data and presenting it overlaid over a map. Therefore, the LGUs providing data directly must have the data available to them.
      </p>

      <h2>About the Software</h2>

      <p>
        The Smart Metro Digital Twin was built on top of TerriaJS. The core platform, <a href="https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs" target="_blank">TerriaJS</a>, was initially developed by Data61 for the NationalMap, but has subsequently been used for other projects. It has been made available to assist with the development of other spatial data viewing applications such as this.
      </p>

      <h2>Additional Open Source Software Used</h2>

      <p>
        In developing the Smart Metro Digital Twin, the research team has used open source software. The platform leverages these excellent open source libraries:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs" target="_blank">TerriaJS</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://cesiumjs.org/" target="_blank">Cesium</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a></li>
      </ul>
