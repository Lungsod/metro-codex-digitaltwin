            establishes guidelines for the protection of personal information
            and applies to both government agencies and private organizations
            involved in the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of personal
            data. It also provides individuals with the right to access and
            correct their personal data held by organizations. For more details
            regarding the Data Privacy Act of 2012, you can visit the official
            website of the
